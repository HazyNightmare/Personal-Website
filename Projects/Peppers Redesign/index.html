							<h3>About Us</h3>
							<hr>
							<blockquote >
								<p class="text-left">
									“Peppers Grill &amp; Bar is a one-of-a-kind local hang-out. We’re active in the community,
									donating our time and money to various civic organizations. Each of us has made a life here,
									raised our children here, and settled into our role as one of the most popular locally-owned &amp;
									operated full-service restaurants in the area.” --Neil Roe, President
								</p>
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								&emsp;&emsp;Thirty years ago, David and Sheila Roe along with their son Neil opened The Clubhouse west of Roswell.
								For a dozen years, The Clubhouse specialized in providing an upscale dining atmosphere.
								<br>
								&emsp;&emsp;Neil had relocated to Roswell to join his parents in this family venture after leaving an executive
								position with a successful Miami, Florida banking institution. His financial background gave him
								a unique perspective allowing him to head up the behind-the-scenes
								administrative workings of the restaurant business.
								<br>
								&emsp;&emsp;By the end of the eighties, the Roe family was preparing for the grand opening of a new casual-style
								restaurant located in the downtown area featuring a menu that would appeal to a wide range of tastes.
								<br>
								<br>
								&emsp;&emsp;After graduating from UNLV with a degree in Hotel-Restaurant Management and working in the industry in
								California for several years, Adam Roe moved to Roswell and joined the family business and by
								1990, Peppers Grill &amp; Bar opened its doors.
								<br>
								<br>
								&emsp;&emsp;Robert Johnston, who was hired as a line cook in 1990, is now vice-president overseeing all
								kitchen operations, both on the premises and all off-site catering. His integrity and work ethic
								led the Roes to offer him a partnership in the restaurant—a position traditionally reserved for
								family members. His natural instincts and creativity have helped to build a unique and varied menu that continues to evolve.
								<br>
								<br>
								&emsp;&emsp;Although David and Sheila Roe have been retired for several years now, Adam, Robert and
								Neil continue to share in the management and day-to-day operations of Peppers Grill &amp; Bar.
								<br>
								<br>
								&emsp;&emsp;As a testament to its local and regional appeal, Peppers Grill &amp; Bar has been in
								business for twenty-five years as of summer 2015.

							<h3>We Cater!</h3>
							<hr>
							<p>
								&emsp;&emsp;We've been known to deliver for office parties and other small gatherings where staff service is
								not necessary. Our own banquet room comfortably accommodates up to forty guests; we can even work
								with you to design a custom menu especially for the occasion. In addition, there are a variety of
								local venues that accommodate larger groups. Several museums allow catered functions and can seat
								up to one hundred people. Roswell’s Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau, located in the downtown area, can
								hold up to six hundred, making it the perfect venue for any large gathering.
								<br>
								&emsp;&emsp;The variety of delicious cuisine we can offer is limited only by your imagination. If the pressure
								of coordinating your event has left you with no creativity to spare, we can help you design the perfect
								menu. Whether your event calls for hors d’oeuvres, a buffet-style selection, or an elegant sit-down dinner,
								we will work with you to design a delectable menu that is sure to impress your guests without emptying your wallet.
								<br>
								<br>
								&emsp;&emsp;Because Peppers Grill &amp; Bar has a full-service liquor license, we are able to provide alcoholic
								beverage services to any function that we cater from a fully-hosted, fully-stocked portable bar
								to a pared-down “cash ‘n’ carry” selection featuring beer &amp; wine, and anywhere in between.
								<br>
								<br>
								&emsp;&emsp;Give us a call at <span style="color: #f02c31;">(575) 623-1700</span> or email us at
								<span style="color: #f02c31;">peppers_banquets@yahoo.com</span> for more information on
								how we can take the stress out of the event planning process for you.
